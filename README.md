# Hello there! üëã I'm Nick Heal

I'm a Full Stack Developer who enjoys the creativity of front end development and the logical puzzles of backend work. From crafting complex solutions to tackling challenging bugs, I have a deep appreciation for the intricacies of JavaScript. And while I love that technical side, I specialize in creating fun and user-friendly interfaces. My drive in coding is to ensure that every part of the web applications I build blends seamlessly, providing a smooth and cohesive experience for everyone.
